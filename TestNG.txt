Testing Next geneartion framework. Generally used for unti testing but
Automation engineers also use it.
available in form of JAR files. - also used Java unit testing framework

--good html reports
--good annotations
--can define priorities/sequence fo test cases , its good feature
--can define dependencies of test cases
--can define grouping of test cases
--most important is data provider feature/parametrization-- very importNT-also interview 
question
--also called TDD framework/heps in desiging test cases initaily with development


--Never write main method in TestNG. testNG will automatically execute the main method
by itself

Annotations:
--Each Annotation should be associated with at least one method
@BeforeSuite
@BeforeTest
@BeforeClass
@BeforeMethod
@Test
@AfterMethod
@AfterClass
@AfterTest
@AfterSuite

--We can define priority of test cases by using keyword for eg (priority=1)
in @Test Annotation
--We can also define groups of test cases as in example below
	@Test(priority=3, groups="Title")
	public void gettitle() {
		String title = driver.getTitle();
		System.out.println(title);
	}
--So after running above tests teh result report will segregate the results accordoing
to groups which will be easier to read

--Creating Dependencies
	for example we are testing a website and first test case is login test case
	it means all other test cases are dependent on login test case. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Data Driven from different sources(different sources used generally as below):
> Excel files- Test Data
> Properties file- Env variables or Test Data
> XML files- Env variables
> JSON files
> DB etc

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Parameters:
By this we pass on global variables or environment variables to the scrpt.
These are variables which don't change and remain constant.
like for eg- which browser to use,
which website to test.(url of website)
which test environment to use(name of env we can choose from environemnt variables)
--These variables are passed through XML and using @Parameters in our Test.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@DataProvider- helps in parametrization and reading from excel and executing 
the test cases for the excel data
